# Entities Singleton

### üß† Entities Singleton

<mark style="color:blue;">`CLIENT`</mark> for an object to be available in the entities list, it must be rendered.\
<mark style="color:red;">`SERVER`</mark> always fully populated, allow to access or manipulate any object, no matter where it is in the world.

All live entity instances are tracked in the `Entities` singleton.\
Each object is uniquely identified by its `uNetId`

Fetch a object instance from its uNetId

#### <mark style="color:$warning;">Entities:waitFor(id, timeout? = 5000)</mark>

Continuously try to fetch a object instance from its uNetId until found or timeout

#### <mark style="color:$warning;">Entities:getBy(key, value)</mark>

Find an instance by a custom field, value can also be a function working as a filter

#### <mark style="color:$warning;">Entities:getAllBy(key, value)</mark>

Returns a table containing all instances that respect the filter, value can also be a function working as a filter

#### <mark style="color:$primary;">Entities:createByName(name)</mark>

***

### Examples:

```lua
local obj = Entities:get(id)                  -- By unique network ID
local crate = Entities:getBy("type", "Crate") -- By field match
```

```lua
local open = Entities:getAllBy("state", function(state) return state.open end)

if open and #open > 0 then
    print(open[1].id.." is an open crate")
end
```

```lua
local specific = Entities:getBy("someCustomId", 100)

if specific then
    print(specific.id.." has the attribute someCustomId setted to 100")
end
```

```lua
local crates = Entities:getAllBy("__type", "Crate")

if crates and #crates > 0 then
    print(crates.id.." is a Crate!")
end
```

## üîç Debug & Tracking Tips

You can easily track which objects are active on the server via `Entities.list`.

Example: list all crates currently spawned:

```lua
for _, obj in pairs(Entities.list) do
    if obj is Crate then
        print("Active crate:", obj.id)
    end
end
```
